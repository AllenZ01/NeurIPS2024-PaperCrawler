# NeurIPS2024-PaperCrawler
This project saves the titles of (1) all accepted papers and (2) papers containing specified words from NeurIPS 2024 into two separate sheets of an Excel file.

All accepted papers are saved in the "all" sheet of "NeurIPS2024_accepted_papers.xls", and papers with `{search}` in their titles are saved in the "`{search}`" sheet of the same Excel file.

This is just a very simple project that I didn't put much effort into, but I hope it can be helpful.
